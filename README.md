This project models the proliferation of cancer cells using Cellular Potts Model (CPM). CPM is a computational framework used to simulate the collective behavior of cells.
<br>
The Cellular Potts Model utilizes the Monte Carlo Algorithm to minimise the overall energy of the system. Our model aims to analyse how different cellular interactions and the number of surrounding cells influence cancer cell proliferation.
A demo of the model can be seen in the video-<br>
